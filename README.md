<!-- Rocket Pitch -->

"The Brewers Website" will offer quality information about the brewing process of numerous beers that we have in our collection. This open-source website will allow fellow community members to edit the information inside the website and add new information that they see fit as well. Also, the website will offer a newsletter for all those beer lovers that want to be kept informed about new beer recipes that arrive at our website.
